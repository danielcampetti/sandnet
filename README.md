SandNet Mapper is a visualization tool designed specifically for the game development platform, The Sandbox. 
Built to streamline and enhance the game creation process, it offers a clear, detailed, and intuitive graphical representation of the intricate logical functions that drive the gameplay mechanics within The Sandbox.

Sandnet is powered by draw.io or diagrams.net. Diagrams.net, previously known as draw.io, is a cross-platform tool for drawing graphs, developed in HTML5 and JavaScript. 
You can use its interface to create different types of diagrams like flowcharts, wireframes, UML diagrams, org charts, and network diagrams. Some of its source code is available under the Apache 2 open-source license.

SandNet offers four graph libraries from The Sandbox Game Maker.

SETUP
Diagrams.io lets you use your files and libraries in a variety of ways, from locally to GitHub or Google Drive.
Google Drive Installation (closed beta 1.3v)

[1] Even without GitHub permissions or an account, you can still download files from the repository. Here's an indicative image on how to do it
![image](https://github.com/danielcampetti/sandnet/assets/82032496/d9ea35d4-8e54-4965-a8a2-559157ba64d2)

[2] After that, unzip the file and you can place it in a folder on Google Drive. 
Due to features like auto-save and real-time project sharing that Google Drive offers, this is the recommended option

[3] Open https://app.diagrams.net
The first thing diagrams will ask you is how you'd like to open your .drawio file. In this case Google Drive.

[4] The first thing diagrams will ask you is how you'd like to open your .drawio file

[5] In this case, we want to open the example file, so use the default credentials and find the file Sandnet_MAIN_1.3v.drawio in the folder you placed it in.

[6] The screen should look something like below. Some minor adjustments for efficiency might be needed, and I can cover that in a later video.

[7] Now you need to import the 5 libraries. The import is a one-time process, just like opening the .drawio project.

[8] Now locate the desired library.

[9] and it will be imported.

[10] After importing the 5 libraries, the installation process is complete.
