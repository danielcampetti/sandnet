App Draw.io https://app.diagrams.net

SandNet Mapper is a visualization tool designed specifically for the game development platform, The Sandbox. 
Built to streamline and enhance the game creation process, it offers a clear, detailed, and intuitive graphical representation of the intricate logical functions that drive the gameplay mechanics within The Sandbox.

Sandnet is powered by draw.io or diagrams.net. Diagrams.net, previously known as draw.io, is a cross-platform tool for drawing graphs, developed in HTML5 and JavaScript. 
You can use its interface to create different types of diagrams like flowcharts, wireframes, UML diagrams, org charts, and network diagrams. Some of its source code is available under the Apache 2 open-source license.
