About Sandnet

Full Documentation: http://sandnet.net (gitbook)

SandNet Mapper is a visualization tool designed specifically for the game development platform, The Sandbox. 
Built to streamline and enhance the game creation process, it offers a clear, detailed, and intuitive graphical representation of the intricate logical functions that drive the gameplay mechanics within The Sandbox.

Sandnet is powered by draw.io or diagrams.net. Diagrams.net, previously known as draw.io, is a cross-platform tool for drawing graphs, developed in HTML5 and JavaScript. 
You can use its interface to create different types of diagrams like flowcharts, wireframes, UML diagrams, org charts, and network diagrams. Some of its source code is available under the Apache 2 open-source license.

SETUP
Diagrams.io lets you use your files and libraries in a variety of ways, from locally to GitHub or Google Drive.
Google Drive Installation (closed beta 1.3v)

[1] Even without GitHub permissions or an account, you can still download files from the repository. Here's an indicative image on how to do it

[2] After that, unzip the file and you can place it in a folder on Google Drive. 
Due to features like auto-save and real-time project sharing that Google Drive offers, this is the recommended option
